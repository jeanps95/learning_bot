## Learning Bot - Tutorial

### The challenge
Learnbotics is a platform that is being developed to teach robotics and does not yet have a simulation model available in Gazebo.

It's suggested to read the following tutorials as a first start on Gazebo robot constructions:

#### Beginner: Model Editor

http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b3

#### Conhecendo seu rob√¥

https://github.com/leo5on/Learnbotics/wiki/Conhecendo-seu-Rob%C3%B4

These two links were the guidelines for construction of the robot.

#### Meshes

Were used theses meshes with the help of the https://onshape.com online software CAD. These were the original meshes, but in this example there are new ones.

#### Intermediate: Velodyne

#### Connect to ROS
